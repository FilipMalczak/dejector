dejector
========

This was a fork of [initial draft of CI made by Jakub Stasiak a few years ago](https://github.com/jstasiak/dejector).

Fork was used as a basis for experimentation that gave birth to internal subpackage
of glue-d project. In fact for quite a while it was a backbone dependency context
used by the framework.

It was almost completely rewritten and I've contacted Jakub before doing that.

Peace.
